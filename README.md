The chest X-ray is one of the most commonly accessible radiological examinations for screening and diagnosis of many lung diseases. This project revolves around application of deep learning inspired computer vision for identifying the presence of nodular-mass abnormality, from the chest X-ray scans of the patient.

# Dataset Used : 
The dataset used for this project comes from National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, and National Institutes of Health, Bethesda. It's christened as ChestX-ray8 dataset. During the entire project, we refer to it as NIH dataset. The providers compiled the dataset of scans from more than 30,000 patients, including many with advanced lung disease. For creating labels, the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports. The labels are expected to be >90% accurate.

The dataset is freely available at : **https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data**, and the paper associated with this dataset can be found at : **https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02315.pdf**.
